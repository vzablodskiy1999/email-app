**Hi, nice to meet you. Thank you for your time, your task was pretty interesting to deal with :)**

I made a decision to make it with Angular. Its bundle is too big for such a small application, and I should better make it with React or Vue, but this application is not for production, and I want you to estimate my Angular skills.

The biggest effort for me was to make it adaptive. Firstly, when I started developing this page I made a decision not to use the html table tag, because I knew that structure would change heavily. So, I had 2 options: 
- to make it adaptive with css
- upload another layout for mobile devices

For production, I would better choose to make 2 layouts because we need to take into consideration such stuff like: semantic, fast loading, accessibility.

In the case of a test project I realized to make it only with styles. I made this structure with the help of bootstrap layout. That was not the best decision, because the table component html code looks a little messy, but unfortunately I didn't have time to refactor it.

Also, I made a decision to use svg code instead of making a font, that is because of the font's bad accessibility.

Other stuff was pretty easy to deal with. Of course, project`s code is not in the condition to post in production, and ,in my opinion, it should be refactored, but I just try to make my best in the shortest time. Things I would change in the code I will describe in the improvement document.

Best regards
